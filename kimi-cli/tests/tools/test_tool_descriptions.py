Start a subagent for focused tasks. Create new or resume by `agent_id`.

**Usage**
- Keep `description` short (3-5 words).
- Use `subagent_type` (default: `coder`), `model` to override.
- Use `resume` to continue existing instances with context.
- Run in foreground by default; `run_in_background=true` only for independent tasks.
- Be explicit: code or research only.
- Subagent results are private—summarize for user if needed.

**Explore Agent** — Preferred for codebase research (read-only). Use when you need >3 searches, module understanding, or concurrent investigations. Specify thoroughness: "quick" (find file), "medium" (understand module), "thorough" (architecture analysis).

**When Not To Use**
Reading known paths, small file searches, tasks completable in 1-2 tool calls.

Execute a bash (`/bin/bash`) command. Use this tool to explore the filesystem, edit files, run scripts, get system information, etc.

**Output:**
The stdout and stderr will be combined and returned as a string. The output may be truncated if it is too long. If the command failed, the exit code will be provided in a system tag.

If `run_in_background=true`, the command will be started as a background task and this tool will return a task ID instead of waiting for command completion. When doing that, you must provide a short `description`. You will be automatically notified when the task completes. Use `TaskOutput` for a non-blocking status/output snapshot, and only set `block=true` when you explicitly want to wait for completion. Use `TaskStop` only if the task must be cancelled. For human users in the interactive shell, background tasks are managed through `/task` only; do not suggest `/task list`, `/task output`, `/task stop`, `/tasks`, or any other invented shell subcommands.

**Guidelines for safety and security:**
- Each shell tool call will be executed in a fresh shell environment. The shell variables, current working directory changes, and the shell history is not preserved between calls.
- The tool call will return after the command is finished. You shall not use this tool to execute an interactive command or a command that may run forever. For possibly long-running commands, you shall set `timeout` argument to a reasonable value.
- Avoid using `..` to access files or directories outside of the working directory.
- Avoid modifying files outside of the working directory unless explicitly instructed to do so.
- Never run commands that require superuser privileges unless explicitly instructed to do so.

**Guidelines for efficiency:**
- For multiple related commands, use `&&` to chain them in a single call, e.g. `cd /path && ls -la`
- Use `;` to run commands sequentially regardless of success/failure
- Use `||` for conditional execution (run second command only if first fails)
- Use pipe operations (`|`) and redirections (`>`, `>>`) to chain input and output between commands
- Always quote file paths containing spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd "/path with spaces/")
- Use `if`, `case`, `for`, `while` control flows to execute complex logic in a single call.
- Verify directory structure before create/edit/delete files or directories to reduce the risk of failure.
- Prefer `run_in_background=true` for long-running builds, tests, watchers, or servers when you need the conversation to continue before the command finishes.
- After starting a background task, do not guess its outcome. Rely on the automatic completion notification whenever possible. Use `TaskOutput` for non-blocking progress snapshots by default, and set `block=true` only when you intentionally want to wait.
- If you need to tell a human shell user how to manage background tasks, only mention `/task`. Do not invent `/task list`, `/task output`, `/task stop`, or `/tasks`.

**Commands available:**
- Shell environment: cd, pwd, export, unset, env
- File system operations: ls, find, mkdir, rm, cp, mv, touch, chmod, chown
- File viewing/editing: cat, grep, head, tail, diff, patch
- Text processing: awk, sed, sort, uniq, wc
- System information/operations: ps, kill, top, df, free, uname, whoami, id, date
- Network operations: curl, wget, ping, telnet, ssh
- Archive operations: tar, zip, unzip
- Other: Other commands available in the shell environment. Check the existence of a command by running `which <command>` before using it.

Find files and directories using glob patterns. This tool supports standard glob syntax like `*`, `?`, and `**` for recursive searches.

On Windows, the `directory` parameter accepts both Windows native paths (`C:\\Users\\foo`) and POSIX-style paths (`/c/Users/foo`, `/cygdrive/c/Users/foo`). Returned paths are in Windows native form with backslashes (NOT POSIX) — convert to forward slashes before using them in Shell commands.

**When to use:**
- Find files matching specific patterns (e.g., all Python files: `*.py`)
- Search for files recursively in subdirectories (e.g., `src/**/*.js`)
- Locate configuration files (e.g., `*.config.*`, `*.json`)
- Find test files (e.g., `test_*.py`, `*_test.go`)

**Example patterns:**
- `*.py` - All Python files in current directory
- `src/**/*.js` - All JavaScript files in src directory recursively
- `test_*.py` - Python test files starting with "test_"
- `*.config.{js,ts}` - Config files with .js or .ts extension

**Bad example patterns:**
- `**`, `**/*.py` - Any pattern starting with '**' will be rejected. Because it would recursively search all directories and subdirectories, which is very likely to yield large result that exceeds your context size. Always use more specific patterns like `src/**/*.py` instead.
- `node_modules/**/*.js` - Although this does not start with '**', it would still highly possible to yield large result because `node_modules` is well-known to contain too many directories and files. Avoid recursively searching in such directories, other examples include `venv`, `.venv`, `__pycache__`, `target`. If you really need to search in a dependency, use more specific patterns like `node_modules/react/src/*` instead.
